# ml-resources-I-like
Collection of machine learning resources (books, blogs, papers, code, etc) I have used and liked. I'm trying to update this as frequently as I can. 

## Machine Learning 
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning - Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani](https://statlearning.com/): The GOAT. 
- [Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction - Kevin Patrick Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html): Going through this book now. Goes a lot deeper into the math than ISLR or Neural Networks and Deep Learning. 
- [Advances in Financial Machine Learning -  Marcos Lopez de Prado](https://www.amazon.ca/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089): While this book does not cover any financial algorithms directly, Lopez de Prado covers the general approach and ideas that are needed for financial ML firms to succeed, as well as some common gotchas (backtest overfitting, data leakage, etc) that occur. This is a good book to have as a reference.
- [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning) is a good course for learning the basics of Scikit-learn as well as some common ML models aside from Neural Networks (Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, SVMs). Similar to the PyTorch course I linked below, I really liked working on their assigmnents and I felt that they gave me a good chance to practice my skills. 

## Deep Learning
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/): Good introductory book and the first one I read. Nielson introduces   deep learning and the basic math behind it by implementing and succesively improving a neural network for classification of handwritten digits (MNIST). The book is a fairly quick read and covers all the important basics (emphasis on basics) for supervised deep learning. 

- [MiniTorch](https://minitorch.github.io/) and [TinyGrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) are two projects that implement a (small) neural network library similar to PyTorch. MiniTorch is a skeleton project that you can code yourself. TinyGrad is a completed library under 1000 lines. It contains all basic operations as well as code that allows the networks to run on GPUs using OpenCL. If you want to see how neural network libraries work behind the scenes both of these are worth lookng at!

- I really liked [this](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) Udacity course on PyTorch. It provides a good introduction to PyTorch and the projects/homework are pretty interesting!
